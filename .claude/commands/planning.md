Make a detailed plan to accomplish this: #$ARGUMENTS

Think hardest.

How will we implement only the functionality we need right now? Identify files
that need to be changed.

Do not include plans for legacy fallback unless required or explicitly
requested.

Write a short overview of what you are about to do.

Write function names and 1-3 sentences about what they do. Write test names and
5-10 words about behavior to cover.
