# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **Works Boilerplate** - a production-ready SaaS starter kit designed
to accelerate development of modern Software-as-a-Service applications. The
boilerplate emphasizes:

- **Mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA)** with offline capabilities
- **Internationalization (i18n)** supporting English, Spanish, and Portuguese
- **Multi-tenancy** with workspace-based data isolation
- **Type-safe full-stack development** with tRPC
- **Security-first approach** with authentication, RLS, and security headers

## Core Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (mobile-first), shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: tRPC on Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (JWT-based)
- **Internationalization**: next-intl
- **PWA**: next-pwa with Workbox
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Testing**: Vitest, Playwright, React Testing Library
- **External Services**: Stripe, Resend, Sentry, PostHog, Inngest

## Development Commands

```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Mobile-First PWA**: All features must work on mobile devices with touch
   interactions. The app should be installable and work offline for critical
   features.

2. **Internationalization**: Every user-facing string must be externalized. Use
   the `useTranslations` hook from next-intl. Routes include locale prefix
   (e.g., `/en/dashboard`).

3. **Multi-Tenancy**: Data isolation is enforced at the database level using Row
   Level Security (RLS). Users can only access data within their authorized
   workspace.

4. **Type Safety**: The entire stack is type-safe from database to frontend.
   tRPC procedures share types automatically. All inputs are validated with Zod.

5. **Component Library**: All UI components are based on shadcn/ui and must be
   mobile-optimized with minimum 44x44px touch targets.

## Development Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Mobile-First Always**: Every feature must work perfectly on mobile before
   desktop
2. **Zero Hardcoded Strings**: All text must use next-intl translations
3. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: No `any` types, full type safety end-to-end
4. **Security by Default**: All inputs validated with Zod, RLS enforced
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work offline, enhanced features
   online

### Code Organization Standards

#### File Structure Rules

- Components: `ComponentName.tsx` with co-located tests and styles
- Pages: Use Next.js 15 App Router structure with `page.tsx`
- API Routes: Use `route.ts` files in app directory
- Types: Keep close to usage, use Zod for runtime validation
- Utilities: Group by domain in `lib/` directory

#### Component Architecture

- **Server Components First**: Use server components by default
- **Client Components**: Only when interactivity is required (use "use client")
- **Atomic Design**: Organize as atoms → molecules → organisms
- **shadcn/ui Base**: Build on shadcn/ui primitives
- **Mobile Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements

### Development Workflow

#### Before Writing Code

1. Check existing patterns in the codebase
2. Verify mobile-first approach
3. Ensure translations are externalized
4. Plan for offline scenarios

#### Code Quality Requirements

- **ESLint**: No warnings allowed
- **Prettier**: Auto-format on save
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no errors
- **Tests**: Write before or during development
- **Performance**: Profile on slow 3G networks

### Testing Strategy

#### Required Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for utilities, hooks, and pure functions
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library for UI components
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user flows
- **Mobile Tests**: Touch interactions and responsive behavior
- **PWA Tests**: Offline functionality and installation

#### Test Organization

- Co-locate tests with components: `Component.test.tsx`
- API tests in `__tests__/api/` directories
- E2E tests in dedicated `tests/e2e/` directory
- Maintain >80% coverage for all new code

### Performance Standards

#### Mobile Performance Targets

- **Lighthouse Score**: >95 in all categories on mobile
- **Time to Interactive**: <3 seconds on 3G
- **Bundle Size**: <150KB initial load
- **PWA Score**: 100% in Lighthouse
- **Core Web Vitals**: Green scores for LCP, FID, CLS

#### Optimization Techniques

- Use `next/image` for all images
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- Code splitting at route and component level
- Optimize fonts with `next/font`
- Cache strategies via service worker

### Security Implementation

#### Input Validation

- **All Inputs**: Validate with Zod schemas on client and server
- **API Endpoints**: Use tRPC with Zod for automatic validation
- **File Uploads**: Validate type, size, and content
- **URL Parameters**: Sanitize and validate all route parameters

#### Authentication & Authorization

- **Supabase Auth**: Use for all authentication flows
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management with HTTP-only cookies
- **RLS Policies**: Enforce data isolation at database level
- **API Protection**: Secure all tRPC procedures with auth checks

#### Security Headers

- **CSP**: Content Security Policy configured
- **CORS**: Properly configured for production
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement on auth endpoints and APIs
- **HTTPS**: Enforced in production environments

### Internationalization Best Practices

#### Translation Management

- **File Structure**: Organize by namespace (auth, dashboard, common)
- **Type Safety**: Generate types from translation keys
- **Fallbacks**: Always provide fallback to English
- **Dynamic Loading**: Load translations on demand for performance

#### Locale Handling

- **URL Structure**: Use `/[locale]/path` for all routes
- **Detection**: Automatic locale detection with user preference
- **Switching**: Smooth language switching without page reload
- **SEO**: Proper hreflang tags and locale-specific meta

### PWA Development

#### Service Worker Implementation

- **Caching Strategies**: Cache-first for assets, network-first for API calls
- **Offline Support**: Critical features must work without internet
- **Background Sync**: Queue actions when offline, sync when online
- **Install Prompts**: Custom PWA installation experience

#### Mobile Optimizations

- **Touch Gestures**: Implement swipe, pinch, and long-press
- **Viewport Handling**: Proper meta tags and safe area handling
- **Performance**: Optimize for mobile CPUs and networks
- **Native Features**: Prepare for push notifications and biometric auth

### Documentation and Knowledge Strategy

Documentation is not a task to be done at the end of a project; it is an ongoing
product that ensures the health, maintainability, and scalability of our team
and system, as well as clarity for other teams.

#### Documentation Philosophy

- **Document the "Why", not just the "What":** Code is self-explanatory about
  _what_ it does. Quality documentation explains _why_ it was done that way,
  what alternatives were considered, and what trade-offs were made.

- **Documentation Lives Close to the Code:** To avoid it becoming outdated, we
  prioritize documentation that can be versioned alongside the source code
  (Markdown files in the repository, TSDoc in the comments), rather than relying
  on external platforms like Confluence or Notion.

#### The three layers of our documentation

##### **The `README.md` (The Gateway)**

- **Tool:** `README.md` in the root of the monorepo.
- **Purpose:** To allow a new developer to set up the environment, install
  dependencies, and run the project locally in the shortest possible time. It is
  our "quick start guide".
- **Responsibility:** It must be kept impeccably clear and up to date. It is the
  first impression a new team member will have of our project. It should contain
  the project vision, prerequisites, step-by-step setup guide, main commands
  (`dev`, `test`, `build`), and a link to this complete Design Doc.

##### **Architectural Documentation (The Constitution)**

- **Tool:** This document (`DESIGN_DOC.md`) and a `/docs/adr` directory for new
  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
- **Purpose:** To explain the high-level decisions, trade-offs, system
  structure, and rationale behind our technology choices. It is the "why"
  record.
- **Responsibility:** Technical leadership is the custodian of this document.
  Significant new architectural decisions (e.g., adding a new microservice,
  changing a database provider) **should** be documented with a new ADR, which
  will be reviewed by the team.

##### **Documentation in Code (The Immediate Context)**

- **Tool:** Comments in **TSDoc** format.
- **Purpose:** To explain the "why" of code snippets that are not immediately
  obvious. We don't comment on the obvious. We do comment on:
- Complex business logic.
- The purpose of public functions and their parameters.
- Temporary workarounds or "hacks", always with a `// TODO:` and a link to the
  ticket that tracks their removal.
- **Responsibility:** Each developer. The Code Review process should actively
  look for complex code without proper documentation and request its addition.

## Task Completion Workflow

**IMPORTANT MEMORY**: When completing any task, you MUST:

1. **Update the original task file** with completion status and learnings
2. **Move the completed task** from `tasks/` to `tasks/completed/` directory
3. **Mark all acceptance criteria** as completed with `[x]` checkboxes
4. **Add implementation summary** at the end of the original task file
5. **Document key learnings** for future reference
6. **Update CLAUDE.md** with new implementation learnings section

Example workflow:

```bash
# After completing task E2_T2.1
mv tasks/E2_T2.1_Internationalization_Setup.md tasks/completed/
# Edit the file to add completion status and mark criteria as done
# Update CLAUDE.md with learnings
```

This ensures all completed work is properly documented and serves as reference
for future development.

##### Tailwind CSS v4 & shadcn/ui Integration

**Critical Issue Resolved**: shadcn/ui styles not rendering due to Tailwind CSS
v4 misconfiguration

**Root Causes Identified**:

1. Missing `@tailwindcss/postcss` package (v4 requires this specific PostCSS
   plugin)
2. Incorrect PostCSS configuration using `tailwindcss: {}` instead of
   `'@tailwindcss/postcss': {}`
3. Mismatch between installed Tailwind version (v3) and configuration (v4)
4. Missing `@theme` directive for custom color definitions in v4

**Solution Applied**:

1. Install required package: `pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/postcss`
2. Update `postcss.config.mjs`:
   ```js
   export default {
     plugins: {
       '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
       autoprefixer: {},
     },
   }
   ```
3. Run upgrade tool: `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade --force`
4. Update `globals.css` to use `@theme` directive:

   ```css
   @import 'tailwindcss';

   @theme {
     --color-background: hsl(0 0% 100%);
     --color-primary: hsl(221.2 83.2% 53.3%);
     /* ... other colors ... */
   }
   ```

**Key Learnings for Tailwind CSS v4**:

- v4 uses `@import 'tailwindcss'` instead of
  `@tailwind base/components/utilities`
- Custom colors must be defined in `@theme` block with `--color-` prefix
- PostCSS requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin, not the legacy `tailwindcss`
  plugin
- The upgrade tool (`npx @tailwindcss/upgrade`) automates most migration tasks
- Theme variables in `@theme` automatically generate utility classes (e.g.,
  `--color-primary` → `bg-primary`)

**Debugging Steps for Future CSS Issues**:

1. Verify CSS is loading: Check browser DevTools Network tab
2. Check if classes exist in compiled CSS:
   `curl [css-url] | grep "\.bg-primary"`
3. Use Playwright to verify classes are in DOM and computed styles are applied
4. Ensure PostCSS is configured correctly for Tailwind v4
5. Verify `@theme` directive is used for custom design tokens

##### Git Workflow and Commit Standards

- **Conventional Commits**: Project uses strict conventional commit format with
  commitlint validation
- **Sentence-Case Rule**: Commit subjects must be in sentence-case (only first
  word capitalized)
  - ✅ **Correct**:
    `feat: Implement advanced tailwind design system with mobile optimization`
  - ❌ **Incorrect**:
    `feat: Implement Tailwind CSS v4 Mobile-First Design System`
- **Subject Length**: Maximum 72 characters for commit subject line
- **Body Formatting**: Maximum 100 characters per line in commit body
- **Scope Validation**: Must use predefined scopes (mobile, pwa, ui, i18n, etc.)
- **Type Validation**: Must use conventional types (feat, fix, docs, style,
  etc.)
- **Husky Hooks**: Updated to remove deprecated v10.0.0 incompatible lines
- **Pre-commit Checks**: Automatic linting, TypeScript validation, mobile
  compliance, and accessibility checks
- **Package Manager**: Project uses pnpm exclusively (`.npmrc` contains
  pnpm-specific configs)
- **npm Warnings**: Normal to see npm warnings about pnpm configs - use `pnpm`
  commands only
- **IMPORTANT**: Always use sentence-case format to avoid commitlint failures
- **🚫 NO CLAUDE ATTRIBUTION**: Never include Claude Code attribution or
  Co-Authored-By lines in commits. Keep commit messages professional and
  project-focused only.

##### Tailwind CSS v4 Custom Colors and Utility Classes

**Issue Resolved**: Custom utility classes with prefixes (e.g.,
`bg-sw-content-background`) not being generated

**Root Cause**: In Tailwind CSS v4, defining CSS custom properties alone doesn't
generate utility classes. Colors must be registered in the `@theme` directive.

**Solution Applied**: Add custom colors to `@theme` directive in `globals.css`:

```css
@theme {
  /* Dashboard-specific colors */
  --color-sw-content-background: var(--background-color);
  --color-sw-text-primary: var(--foreground-color);
  --color-sw-text-secondary: var(--muted-foreground-color);
  /* ... other sw- prefixed colors ... */
}
```

**Key Learnings**:

- Tailwind v4 requires colors in `@theme` directive to generate utility classes
- CSS custom properties (`:root { --sw-var: value }`) alone won't create
  utilities
- The `--color-` prefix in `@theme` is required for color utilities
- Custom prefixes work perfectly when properly registered
- Verify utility generation by checking compiled CSS output

**Debugging Approach**:

1. Check if classes exist in compiled CSS: `curl [css-url] | grep "\.bg-sw-"`
2. Test with a simple component to isolate the issue
3. Verify @theme directive syntax matches Tailwind v4 requirements
4. Ensure PostCSS pipeline is correctly configured for v4

##### ICU MessageFormat Currency Formatting

- **Correct Syntax**: Use ICU skeleton syntax
  `{amount, number, ::currency/CODE}` for currency formatting
- **Currency Codes**: Must use ISO-4217 currency codes (USD, BRL, EUR, etc.)
- **Common Mistakes**:
  - ❌ `{amount, number, currency}` - Missing currency code specification
  - ❌ `R$ {amount, number, currency}` - Don't hardcode currency symbols
  - ❌ `€{amount, number, currency}` - Let ICU handle symbol placement
- **Correct Examples**:
  - ✅ `{amount, number, ::currency/USD}` - Formats as $1,234.56 in en-US
  - ✅ `{amount, number, ::currency/BRL}` - Formats as R$ 1.234,56 in pt-BR
  - ✅ `{amount, number, ::currency/EUR}` - Formats as 1.234,56 € in es-ES
- **Benefits**: Automatic locale-aware formatting with correct symbols, decimal
  separators, and thousand separators
- **Dynamic Currency**: For multi-currency support, pass currency as parameter:
  `{amount, number, ::currency/{currency}}`
- **Next-intl Integration**: Works seamlessly with next-intl's `formatNumber`
  function

##### Locale-Aware Navigation Components

- **Issue**: Navigation components using hardcoded paths fail with
  internationalized routing
- **Root Cause**: Direct paths like `/dashboard` don't match actual routes like
  `/pt/dashboard`
- **Solution Applied**: All navigation components now handle locale-aware
  routing:
  1. Extract current locale with `useLocale()` hook
  2. Strip locale from pathname for route matching:
     `pathnameWithoutLocale = '/' + pathSegments.slice(2).join('/') || '/'`
  3. Prefix all hrefs with locale: `href={`/${locale}${path}`}`
- **Components Fixed**:
  - `dashboard-breadcrumb.tsx`: Route lookup and href generation
  - `app-sidebar.tsx`: Menu items and logo links
  - `user-settings-menu.tsx`: All navigation links
  - `BottomTabNavigation.tsx`: Mobile tab navigation
- **Pattern for Future Components**:
  ```tsx
  const locale = useLocale()
  const pathname = usePathname()
  const pathnameWithoutLocale =
    '/' + pathname.split('/').slice(2).join('/') || '/'
  // Use pathnameWithoutLocale for comparisons
  // Use `/${locale}/path` for all Link hrefs
  ```
- **Special Cases**:
  - Root path: Use `/${locale}` or `/${locale}/dashboard`, not just `/`
  - Dynamic paths: Always include locale prefix before parameters

##### Dynamic Navigation Active States with Internationalization

**Issue Resolved**: Sidebar navigation items had hardcoded `active` states that
never updated based on current route

**Root Cause**: Static boolean values in navigation arrays instead of dynamic
route detection

**Solution Applied**:

1. Remove `active` property from navigation arrays
2. Add `usePathname` hook from `next/navigation`
3. Create `isActive` function that:
   - Strips locale prefix using regex: `/^\/[a-z]{2}(-[A-Z]{2})?/`
   - Handles home page edge case explicitly
   - Uses `startsWith` for nested route support
4. Apply dynamic active state check in render logic

**Implementation Pattern**:

```typescript
const pathname = usePathname()

const isActive = (href: string) => {
  const pathWithoutLocale = pathname.replace(/^\/[a-z]{2}(-[A-Z]{2})?/, '')

  if (href === '/') {
    return pathWithoutLocale === '' || pathWithoutLocale === '/'
  }

  return pathWithoutLocale.startsWith(href)
}

// In render:
const active = isActive(item.href)
```

**Key Learnings**:

- Always use dynamic route detection for navigation active states
- Consider internationalization when comparing routes (strip locale prefixes)
- Use `startsWith` for hierarchical route matching (e.g., `/projects` matches
  `/projects/123`)
- Apply same logic consistently across all navigation sections
- Next.js `usePathname` returns the full path including locale prefix

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:

- Don't hardcode active states in navigation arrays
- Don't forget to handle the home page (`/`) as a special case
- Don't use exact matching for routes that may have nested paths
- Remember that internationalized routes include locale prefix

### Development Workflow

#### Before Writing Code

1. Check existing patterns in the codebase
2. Verify mobile-first approach
3. Ensure translations are externalized
4. Plan for offline scenarios
5. **NEW**: Run `pnpm check` for type safety and linting

#### Enhanced Scripts Available

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Development server
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm check            # TypeScript + ESLint check
pnpm lint:fix         # Auto-fix linting issues
pnpm analyze          # Bundle analysis with visualization
pnpm clean            # Clean build artifacts

# Code Quality (NEW)
pnpm validate         # Complete validation (typecheck + lint + format check)
pnpm format           # Format all files with Prettier
pnpm format:check     # Check formatting without changes
pnpm mobile:validate  # Mobile-specific compliance checks
pnpm pre-commit       # Manual pre-commit checks

# Internationalization (NEW)
pnpm i18n:validate    # Validate translation files and ICU syntax
pnpm i18n:check       # Alias for i18n:validate
pnpm i18n:extract     # Extract translation keys (future implementation)

# Database (Prisma)
pnpm db:push          # Push schema changes
pnpm db:migrate       # Run migrations
pnpm db:studio        # Open Prisma Studio
pnpm db:seed          # Seed database
pnpm db:generate      # Generate Prisma client

# Testing (Future Implementation)
pnpm test             # Run unit tests
pnpm test:ui          # Test with UI
pnpm test:coverage    # Coverage reports
pnpm test:e2e         # End-to-end tests
```

### Next Steps

1. Run `task-master next` to see the next available task
2. Review task details with `task-master show <task-id>`
3. Follow mobile-first development principles
4. Ensure all code meets the Definition of Done criteria
5. **Use `pnpm validate` before every commit (replaces `pnpm check`)**
6. **Use `pnpm analyze` to monitor bundle size during feature development**
7. **Use `pnpm i18n:validate` to check translation consistency**
8. **Database operations ready with Prisma scripts when schema is implemented**
9. **NEW**: Git hooks automatically run quality checks on commit
10. **NEW**: VS Code workspace optimized for mobile-first development
11. **NEW**: Comprehensive internationalization system with 3 languages ready
