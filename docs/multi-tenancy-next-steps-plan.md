# Multi-Tenancy Implementation: Next Steps Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the multi-tenancy
implementation for Works Boilerplate. We have completed 80% of the
implementation with all core backend functionality ready. The remaining 20%
focuses on UI implementation, user experience, and quality assurance.

**Members Router Tests** (`members.test.ts`):

- Invite member
- Remove member
- Update role
- Transfer ownership
- Leave workspace

**Invitation Router Tests** (`invitation.test.ts`):

- Role-based access control
- Cross-workspace access prevention

**E2E Tests** (Playwright):

- Complete signup → workspace creation flow
- Invitation acceptance flow
- Workspace switching
- Member management
- Settings updates

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements (Low Priority)

#### 5.1 Empty States

## Technical Considerations

### 1. State Management

- Use tRPC's caching effectively
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Handle stale data gracefully

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness

- Test all new pages on mobile devices
- Ensure touch targets are 44x44px minimum
- Use responsive tables or card layouts

### 3. Accessibility

- Add proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers

### 4. Internationalization

- Keep all new strings in translation files
- Use proper pluralization
- Format dates/times correctly

### 5. Error Recovery

- Implement retry logic for failed requests
- Provide clear error messages
- Allow users to recover from errors

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**
   - All acceptance criteria met
   - No critical bugs
   - Performance targets achieved

2. **User Experience**
   - Smooth onboarding flow
   - Intuitive workspace management
   - Clear feedback messages

3. **Code Quality**
   - > 80% test coverage
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - No ESLint errors

4. **Security**
   - All endpoints protected
   - Data isolation verified
   - No security vulnerabilities

## Resources Needed

1. **Design Assets**
   - Empty state illustrations
   - Success/error icons
   - Loading animations

2. **External Services**
   - Email sending (Resend)
   - File upload (for logos)
   - Analytics tracking

3. **Documentation**
   - User guide for workspace management
   - Admin guide for workspace owners
   - API documentation updates

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity Risk**: Start with MVP features, add advanced features later
2. **Performance Risk**: Implement pagination early, optimize queries
3. **Security Risk**: Regular security reviews, penetration testing
4. **UX Risk**: User testing sessions, iterative improvements

## Definition of Done

The multi-tenancy implementation is complete when:

1. ✅ All UI pages are implemented and responsive
2. ✅ Onboarding flow guides new users smoothly
3. ✅ Invitation system works end-to-end
4. ✅ All tests pass with >80% coverage
5. ✅ Security audit shows no vulnerabilities
6. ✅ Performance meets targets (<100ms response times)
7. ✅ Documentation is complete and accurate
8. ✅ Feature is deployed to production

---

This plan provides a clear roadmap to complete the multi-tenancy implementation.
The backend is solid; now we need to create an excellent user experience on top
of it.
