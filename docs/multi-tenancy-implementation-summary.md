# Multi-Tenancy Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the multi-tenancy implementation for the Works
Boilerplate. The system provides workspace-based data isolation with role-based
access control.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (✅ Completed)

**Files Modified:**

- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added Workspace, WorkspaceMember, and Invitation
  models
- `/supabase/migrations/20250102_multi_tenancy.sql` - Created migration with RLS
  policies

**Key Models:**

- **Workspace**: Stores workspace information (name, slug, logo, settings)
- **WorkspaceMember**: Junction table linking users to workspaces with roles
- **Invitation**: Manages workspace invitations with secure tokens
- **User**: Updated with `activeWorkspaceId` and `lastActiveAt` fields

**Database Features:**

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for complete data isolation
- Helper functions for permission checks
- Automatic workspace creation for new users
- Soft delete support for workspaces

### 2. API Layer (✅ Completed)

**Files Created/Modified:**

- `/src/server/api/trpc.ts` - Enhanced context with workspace data and
  middleware
- `/src/server/api/routers/workspace.ts` - Workspace CRUD operations
- `/src/server/api/routers/members.ts` - Member management
- `/src/server/api/routers/invitation.ts` - Invitation handling
- `/src/server/api/routers/auth.ts` - Updated to include workspace in session
- `/src/server/api/root.ts` - Added new routers

**Key Features:**

- Workspace-aware tRPC context
- Role-based middleware (member, admin, owner)
- Comprehensive workspace operations
- Secure invitation system
- Member management with role updates

### 3. UI Components (✅ Completed)

**Files Created:**

- `/src/components/workspace/WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx` - Dropdown for workspace
  switching
- `/src/contexts/workspace-context.tsx` - React context for workspace state

**Features:**

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface (44x44px targets)
- Real-time workspace switching
- Role-based UI elements

### 4. Internationalization (✅ Completed)

**Files Modified:**

- `/messages/en.json` - English translations
- `/messages/pt.json` - Portuguese translations
- `/messages/es.json` - Spanish translations

**Translation Categories:**

- Workspace UI labels
- Form fields and validation
- Member management
- Invitation flow
- Error messages

## What's Still Pending

### 1. Workspace Settings Pages (Medium Priority)

- General settings page (name, logo, etc.)
- Members management page with table
- Danger zone for workspace deletion

### 2. Onboarding Flow (Medium Priority)

- First workspace creation after signup
- Team invitation during onboarding
- Guided setup experience

### 3. Testing (Low Priority)

- Unit tests for workspace operations
- Integration tests for RLS policies
- E2E tests for complete flows

### 4. Final Validation (Low Priority)

- Security audit
- Performance testing
- Code quality checks

## How to Use

### For Developers

1. **Run the migration** on your Supabase project:

   ```sql
   -- Copy contents of /supabase/migrations/20250102_multi_tenancy.sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL editor
   ```

2. **Generate Prisma client**:

   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   ```

3. **Use the WorkspaceSwitcher** in your layout:

   ```tsx
   import { WorkspaceSwitcher } from '@/components/workspace/WorkspaceSwitcher'
   ;<header>
     <WorkspaceSwitcher />
   </header>
   ```

4. **Access workspace context** in components:

   ```tsx
   import { useWorkspace } from '@/contexts/workspace-context'

   const { activeWorkspace, userRole } = useWorkspace()
   ```

5. **Use workspace-aware procedures**:

   ```tsx
   // Requires active workspace and member role
   api.workspace.update.useMutation()

   // Requires admin role
   api.members.invite.useMutation()

   // Requires owner role
   api.members.transferOwnership.useMutation()
   ```

### Security Notes

- All data queries are automatically filtered by workspace
- RLS policies enforce isolation at database level
- API layer provides additional permission checks
- Invitation tokens are secure and time-limited

### Next Steps

1. Create workspace settings UI pages
2. Implement onboarding flow for new users
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Conduct security audit
5. Performance optimization for large workspaces

## Architecture Decisions

1. **UUID for IDs**: Better security and Supabase compatibility
2. **Slug-based URLs**: Human-readable workspace identification
3. **Soft Deletes**: 30-day retention for accidental deletions
4. **Role Hierarchy**: Owner (1) > Admin (many) > Member (many)
5. **Default Workspace**: Auto-created personal workspace on signup

## Migration Path

For existing users without workspaces:

1. Migration automatically creates personal workspaces
2. Users become owners of their personal workspace
3. Workspace slug generated from user name/email

## Performance Considerations

- Indexed columns for fast lookups (slug, user_id, workspace_id)
- Cursor-based pagination for member lists
- Efficient RLS policies using indexes
- Workspace data cached in tRPC context

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-tenant SaaS
applications with proper data isolation, security, and user experience.
